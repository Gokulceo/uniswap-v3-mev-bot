**Profit-First Arbitrage, Liquidation & MEV Execution Engine — For the Hungry, By the Relentless.**

Flashloan-powered MEV bot for **Ethereum** & **Arbitrum**, engineered for maximum ROI with minimal startup costs.  
Runs **arbitrage**, **sandwich attacks**, **liquidations**, and **post-sequencer snipes** across **Uniswap V2/V3**, **SushiSwap**, **Curve**, and **PancakeSwap**.  
No trading capital required — just gas fees. Arbitrum’s low fees make scaling cheap, aggressive, and fast.

---

## 📌 Why This Bot? Why Start on Arbitrum?

You don’t need 0.25, 0.5, or even 2 ETH to start.  
On Ethereum mainnet, simply deploying an MEV bot can burn **hundreds of dollars** in gas before you even process your first profitable trade — and if you’re inexperienced, you’ll be front-run by more seasoned bots almost instantly.

**Arbitrum flips the script:**

* **Contract Deployment:** <\$1 in gas fees.  
* **Daily Operation Costs:** \$50–\$100 keeps the bot running *for days*, even at high frequency.  
* **Funding:** Bridge ETH or swap to Arbitrum-native ETH in seconds for instant gas.

> Arbitrum is your training ground, battle arena, and profit engine — all in one.  
> Learn the ropes here, refine your strategies, make profits, and only then bring your battle-tested edge to Ethereum mainnet.

## 📌 Why Arbitrum Is More Than a “Testnet with Benefits”

Arbitrum isn’t just a cheaper sandbox. It’s a **prime MEV hunting ground** with unique edges over Ethereum:

* **Post-Sequencer MEV (State-Change Sniping)** – Exploit opportunities after sequencer ordering but before block finalization.  
* **Lucrative Liquidations** – Strike high-value lending protocol liquidations with minimal gas wars.  
* **Price Imbalance Exploitation** – Thousands of cross-DEX routes misalign *every hour*.  
* **Low Gas = Aggressive Search** – Run *thousands* of simulations or txs per second without draining your bankroll.  
* **Scalable Operations** – Deploy multiple bots in parallel without exponential cost increases.

## 🧠 MEV Startup Advice — From a Searcher & DeFi Builder’s Perspective

### 1️⃣ Don’t burn your bankroll on gas learning curves

Jumping straight into Ethereum mainnet without a refined strategy is like walking into a sniper range wearing a neon target.
Mainnet bots are **faster**, **more aggressive**, and will eat your margins alive before you even settle your first block.

---

### 2️⃣ Use Arbitrum to train your bot reflexes

With fees at **pennies per transaction**, Arbitrum lets you:

* 🚀 Run **thousands** of profit/failure cycles.
* ⏱ Fine-tune **sandwich attack timing** and **arbitrage routing**.
* 🛡 Simulate liquidation triggers without paying hundreds for a failed snipe.
* 💹 Arbitrage across DEXs after **large swaps distort prices**, executing hundreds/thousands of route variations for up to **80% higher hit/inclusion rates**.
* 📊 Exploit updated oracle prices for **delta-neutral trades**.

---

### 3️⃣ Battle-Test, Then Scale

Once your strategy is **profitable + proven**:

* 🔄 Port your contracts to Ethereum mainnet.
* 💥 Use *high-tps bursts* to brute-force your way into profitable blocks.
* 🪙 Apply **capital allocation techniques** to survive longer in the predator-heavy mainnet arena.

---

💡 **Bottom line:**
Arbitrum is where you **learn, adapt, and profit**.
Ethereum is where you **hunt big game**.

## 🧠 Flashloans — Explained Like a Friendly Neighbor

Imagine your neighbor lends you **\$1,000** to buy a painting, but says:

> “Bring it back in one minute, or I’ll take your car.”

You buy the painting for \$1,000, instantly sell it for \$1,200, give the \$1,000 back, and keep the **\$200** — all in one seamless transaction.

That’s how **flashloans** work in DeFi — borrow instantly with **no collateral**, and repay within the **same block**.

---

## ⚡️ Features

* **Arbitrage Engine** — Executes profit opportunities across Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap, Curve, PancakeSwap.
* **Sandwich Attack Module** — Captures slippage from large pending trades.
* **Liquidation Monitor** — Watches lending protocols for undercollateralized positions.
* **Flashloan-Powered** — Minimal starting capital needed; just pay gas fees.
* **Simulation Mode (Mainnet)** — Preview potential profits before spending gas, avoiding zero-profit failures.
* **Simulation Mode (Arbitrum)** — Less dominant here due to faster finality (2-3 sec vs 12-13 sec on mainnet); simulation latency affects speed-sensitive strategies.
* **Execution Mode** — Fully autonomous, real-time transactions.
* **One-Click Profit Withdrawal** — Secure and instant.

---

### 📑 Audit & Validation Phase

Before public release, this bot went through a **comprehensive internal audit** in our private **`uniswap-v3-mev-bot-audit-repo`**.

**Audit coverage included:**

* **Solidity Static Analysis** — Slither, MythX, and custom invariant checks.
* **Gas Profiling** — Function-level optimization for <1% overhead.
* **Flashloan Execution Testing** — Simulations across multiple DEX environments under variable slippage and liquidity conditions.
* **Failure Simulation** — Forced reverts, mempool contention, and race-condition handling.
* **Security Hardening** — Strict access control, guaranteed flashloan repayment, and sandwich-defense bypass mechanisms.

**Arbitrum-specific stress-testing:**
Given Arbitrum’s **sequencer-based architecture** (no public mempool), strategies required **non-standard execution tuning**. We performed **sequencer post-order injection testing** and **off-chain simulation bursts**, ensuring the bot remains **battle-ready** in environments where transaction ordering is not predictable via mempool sniping alone.

✅ Survives high-frequency execution bursts without stalls.
✅ Handles Ethereum mempool dynamics *and* Arbitrum’s sequencer ordering.
✅ Maintains capital safety even in failed or front-run transactions.
✅ Achieves target gas efficiency on both chains.
